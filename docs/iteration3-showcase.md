Iteration 3 Tasks and Responsibilities

Iteration 3 of the Robot World project focuses on further enhancing server-side and client-side functionalities, introducing new features, and ensuring robust testing and integration.
Job 1: Server Configuration Enhancements (Prudence)
Responsibilities:

    Develop tests to ensure server configuration for visibility, shields, and weapon reloading.
    Implement functionality to configure visibility, shields, and weapon reloading based on the tests.
    Verify that all tests pass and refactor code for clarity and flexibility.

Job 2: Client Shield and Hit Tracking (Thabiso)
Responsibilities:

    Define tests for implementing shields for robots and tracking hits taken.
    Develop functionality to implement shields for robots and accurately track hits based on tests.
    Test the shield and hit tracking implementation thoroughly and refactor code for performance and scalability.

Job 3: Client Repair and Reload Commands (Karabo)
Responsibilities:

    Write tests for repair and reload commands in the client.
    Implement functionality for the repair and reload commands based on the tests.
    Ensure all tests pass and refactor code for better structure and efficiency.

Job 4: Server Robot Management (Zama)
Responsibilities:

    Develop tests to ensure that a robot is removed from the world when killed (shields are zero).
    Implement functionality in the server to remove a robot from the world upon being killed, based on the tests.
    Test robot management functionality thoroughly and refactor code for clarity and maintainability.

Job 5: Testing and Integration (Ntokozo)
Responsibilities:

    Write integration tests to ensure smooth communication between server and client components.
    Perform thorough testing of the entire system, including individual components and integrated functionality.
    Refine and optimize the codebase based on test results and feedback, maintaining a focus on test coverage and reliability.

This plan outlines specific responsibilities for each team member (Prudence, Thabiso, Karabo, Zama, and Ntokozo) in Iteration 3 of the project. Each job is aimed at enhancing different aspects of the Robot World simulation, from server-side configuration enhancements and robot management to client-side commands and testing.
