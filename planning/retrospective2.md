Participants: [List of Team Members]
What went well:

    Server World Configuration (Prudence)
        Achievement: Successfully developed tests and implemented dynamic world size configuration.
        Impact: Removed hard-coded world size, allowing configurable world dimensions based on requirements.

    Server Obstacle Implementation (Thabiso)
        Achievement: Defined tests and implemented support for multiple obstacles in the world.
        Impact: Enhanced world complexity with varied obstacle placements, improving simulation realism.

    Server Command Enhancement (Karabo)
        Achievement: Improved robot command functionalities to display robot states.
        Impact: Enhanced command usability and clarity, facilitating better robot control and management.

    Client Movement and Visibility (Ntokozo)
        Achievement: Implemented robot movement commands (forward, back, left, right) and visibility constraints.
        Impact: Robots now navigate the world more dynamically, considering obstacles and visibility limitations.

    Client Fire Command Implementation (Zama)
        Achievement: Successfully implemented the fire command functionality with shot management and distance considerations.
        Impact: Robots can engage in combat scenarios more effectively, adding depth to simulation interactions.

What could be improved:

    Integration Testing
        Observation: Limited integration testing between server and client components.
        Action Item: Increase focus on integration tests to ensure smooth communication and behavior alignment.

    Performance Optimization
        Observation: Potential areas for performance enhancement in obstacle handling and command execution.
        Action Item: Refactor code for better performance where identified, ensuring efficient resource usage.

    Error Handling
        Observation: Continued improvement needed in error handling, especially in edge cases and unexpected inputs.
        Action Item: Implement comprehensive error handling strategies to enhance system resilience and user experience.

Action Items for Iteration 3:

    Server Configuration Enhancements (Prudence)
        Develop tests and implement configuration for visibility, shields, and weapon reloading.
        Refactor code to accommodate new configurations and ensure integration with existing functionalities.

    Client Shield and Hit Tracking (Thabiso)
        Define tests and implement shields for robots, along with accurate hit tracking.
        Refine shield management and hit detection logic for accuracy and efficiency.

    Client Repair and Reload Commands (Karabo)
        Write tests and implement repair and reload commands in the client.
        Ensure seamless integration with robot actions and world state management.

    Server Robot Management (Zama)
        Develop tests and implement removal of robots upon being killed (shields reaching zero).
        Refactor robot management logic for clarity and maintainability.

    Testing and Integration (Ntokozo)
        Write comprehensive integration tests to validate communication between server and client components.
        Perform thorough testing of the entire system, focusing on end-to-end scenarios and edge cases.

Conclusion:

Iteration 2 demonstrated significant progress with enhanced functionalities and expanded capabilities in the Robot World project. Identified areas for improvement, particularly in integration, performance, and error handling, will be addressed in Iteration 3 to further refine the system and prepare for additional feature implementations.
