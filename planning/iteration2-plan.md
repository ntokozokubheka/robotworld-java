Iteration 2: Server and Client Enhancements
Goals:

    Server World Configuration (Prudence)
        Develop tests for dynamically configuring the size of the world.
        Implement world size configuration based on tests.
        Refactor code for clarity and flexibility.

    Server Obstacle Implementation (Thabiso)
        Define tests for adding multiple obstacles to the world.
        Implement functionality to add and manage multiple obstacles.
        Refactor obstacle implementation for performance and scalability.

    Server Command Enhancement (Karabo)
        Write tests to enhance robot commands to display each robot's state.
        Implement command enhancements based on tests (e.g., state display).
        Refactor command handling for readability and maintainability.

    Client Movement and Visibility (Ntokozo)
        Create tests for robot movement commands (forward, back, left, right).
        Implement movement functionality ensuring obstacle and robot interactions are respected.
        Define and implement visibility constraints for the "look" command.
        Refactor movement and visibility logic for improved structure and efficiency.

    Client Fire Command Implementation (Zama)
        Write tests for the fire command to ensure correct functionality.
        Implement fire command functionality based on tests (shots, bullet distance).
        Refactor fire command implementation for improved test coverage and code quality.

Tasks Distribution:

    Prudence (Server World Configuration)
        Develop tests and implement dynamic world size configuration.
    Thabiso (Server Obstacle Implementation)
        Define tests and implement multiple obstacle management in the server.
    Karabo (Server Command Enhancement)
        Write tests and enhance robot commands to display state information.
    Ntokozo (Client Movement and Visibility)
        Create tests and implement robot movement and visibility commands on the client.
    Zama (Client Fire Command Implementation)
        Write tests and implement the fire command functionality on the client.
