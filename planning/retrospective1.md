Date: [Insert Date]

Participants: [List of Team Members]
What went well:

    Object-Oriented Design
        Achievement: Successfully implemented modular design using interfaces and abstract classes.
        Impact: Enabled easy extension of functionalities and improved code reusability.

    Robot Functionality
        Achievement: Implemented core robot actions such as movement and direction management.
        Impact: Robots interact effectively within the simulated world, responding to commands accurately.

    World Simulation
        Achievement: Created a simulated environment with boundaries and obstacle interactions.
        Impact: Provides a realistic platform for robots to navigate, avoiding obstacles dynamically.

    Command Handling
        Achievement: Implemented command design patterns to encapsulate robot actions.
        Impact: Enhanced maintainability and flexibility, allowing seamless addition of new commands.

    Testing and Validation
        Achievement: Conducted thorough unit testing for core functionalities.
        Impact: Ensured reliability and robustness of the system, validating expected behaviors.

What could be improved:

    Documentation
        Observation: Documentation could be more comprehensive, especially regarding method descriptions and usage examples.
        Action Item: Allocate more time for detailed Javadoc comments in subsequent iterations to enhance clarity.

    Error Handling
        Observation: Error handling mechanisms need improvement, especially in edge cases and exceptional scenarios.
        Action Item: Implement robust error handling strategies to improve system resilience and user experience.

    Integration
        Observation: Limited integration testing between components such as robots, obstacles, and the world.
        Action Item: Prioritize integration testing in Iteration 2 to ensure seamless communication and behavior consistency.

Action Items for Iteration 2:

    Server World Configuration (Prudence)
        Develop tests and implement dynamic world size configuration.
        Remove hard-coded world size and refactor code for configurability.

    Server Obstacle Implementation (Thabiso)
        Define tests and implement multiple obstacle support in the world.
        Refactor obstacle handling for improved performance and scalability.

    Server Command Enhancement (Karabo)
        Write tests and enhance robot command functionalities to display robot states.
        Refactor command execution logic for readability and maintainability.

    Client Movement and Visibility (Ntokozo)
        Create tests and implement robot movement commands (forward, back, left, right).
        Implement visibility constraints for the look command and ensure interaction with obstacles and other robots.

    Client Fire Command Implementation (Zama)
        Write tests and implement the fire command functionality, considering shots and bullet distance.
        Refactor fire command logic for improved test coverage and code quality.

Conclusion:

Iteration 1 was successful in laying a strong foundation with modular design, core functionalities, and initial testing. Identified areas for improvement, such as documentation, error handling, and integration, will be addressed in Iteration 2 to enhance overall system quality and user experience.
