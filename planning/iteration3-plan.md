Iteration 3: Server and Client Enhancements
Goals:

    Server Configuration Enhancements (Prudence)
        Develop tests for configuring visibility, shields, and weapon reloading.
        Implement functionality to configure these aspects based on tests.
        Refactor code for clarity and flexibility.

    Client Shield and Hit Tracking (Thabiso)
        Define tests for implementing shields and tracking hits for robots.
        Implement shield functionality and accurately track hits based on tests.
        Refactor shield and hit tracking logic for performance and scalability.

    Client Repair and Reload Commands (Karabo)
        Write tests for repair and reload commands in the client.
        Implement repair and reload functionality based on tests.
        Refactor command implementation for improved structure and efficiency.

    Server Robot Management (Zama)
        Develop tests for removing robots from the world when their shields are zero.
        Implement functionality to remove robots upon being killed based on tests.
        Refactor robot management for clarity and maintainability.

    Testing and Integration (Ntokozo)
        Write integration tests to ensure smooth communication between server and client.
        Perform comprehensive testing of the entire system, including components and integrated functionality.
        Refine codebase based on test results and feedback to enhance reliability and maintainability.

Tasks Distribution:

    Prudence (Server Configuration Enhancements)
        Develop tests and implement configurations for visibility, shields, and weapon reloading.
    Thabiso (Client Shield and Hit Tracking)
        Define tests and implement shield functionality and hit tracking for robots.
    Karabo (Client Repair and Reload Commands)
        Write tests and implement repair and reload commands on the client.
    Zama (Server Robot Management)
        Develop tests and implement robot removal based on shield depletion in the server.
    Ntokozo (Testing and Integration)
        Write integration tests and perform comprehensive testing across the system.

This plan outlines the tasks, responsibilities, and goals for each team member in Iteration 3 of the Robot World project. Each task focuses on enhancing server-side and client-side functionalities related to configuration, robot management, command enhancements, shield tracking, hit management, and system testing and integration. Adjustments can be made based on team dynamics and project requirements during implementation.
